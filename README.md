ColEm-pb
========

A ColecoVision emulator.

The controller buttons that are visible on the screen are:
- The standard number pad buttons (0-9, #, and *),
- The dpad,
- The left fire button (yellow),
- The right fire button (red),
- And two SuperAction buttons (blue and purple)
There are also 4 buttons that aren't visible on the screen. They can be located by swiping downward from the top of the screen. The non-visible buttons are:
- ROM selector (top left),
- Load/Save state buttons (bottom left),
- And a 1st/2nd controller switcher (just left of the * key).

First run the emulator to let it set up the default directories. Then, you must put a ColecoVision BIOS in the misc/ColEm/BIOS directory. The BIOS must be named COLECO.ROM (case sensitive). ROMs go in misc/ColEm/ROM.
