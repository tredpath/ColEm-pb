========

A ColecoVision emulator.

The standard number pad buttons (0-9, #, and *), the dpad, the left fire button (yellow), the right fire button (red), and two SuperAction buttons (blue and purple) are all visible on the screen during game play. There are also 4 buttons that aren't visible on the screen. They can be located and moved by swiping downward from the top of the screen. The non-visible buttons are:
- ROM selector (top left)
- Load/Save state buttons (bottom left)
- 1st/2nd controller switcher (just left of the * key).
